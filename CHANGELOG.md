## v1.0.2 - Clarified Google Sheets automation messaging
Refined the docs and dependency metadata so the module clearly advertises Google Sheets automation helpers while the manifest stays aligned with the published release.

### Changed
- Reworded the README and docs intro copy to highlight everyday Google Sheets automation workflows and reliable exports.
- Updated the in-file dependency references to `@latest` so the helper metadata matches the package manifest.

## v1.0.1 - GSheet publication polish
Documented the latest @instago/gsheet release so searchable metadata stays current and the package looks fresh in discovery listings.

### Fixed
- Locked the published metadata to version 1.0.1 to match the package manifest and prepare the module for release.
